If you need help, have a look at @sec-rmd.\n\n## Task 3: Load in the library and read in the data {.unnumbered}\n\nThe data should already be in your project folder. If you want a fresh copy, you can download the data again here: [data_pair_coding](data/data_pair_coding.zip \"download\").\n\nWe are using the packages `tidyverse` and `performance` today.\nIf you have already worked through this chapter, you will have all the packages installed. If you have yet to complete @sec-reg, you will need to install the package `performance` (see @sec-install_packages for guidance if needed).\n\nWe also need to read in `dog_data_clean_wide.csv`. Again, I've named my data object `dog_data_wide` to shorten the name but feel free to use whatever object name sounds intuitive to you. \n\n\n```{r reading in data for me, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\n\ndog_data_wide <- read_csv(\"data/dog_data_clean_wide.csv\")\n\ndog_reg <- dog_data_wide %>%\n  select(RID, Loneliness_post, SCS_pre) %>% \n  drop_na()\n\nmod <- lm(Loneliness_post~SCS_pre, data = dog_reg)\n```\n\n\n## Task 4: Tidy data & Selecting variables of interest {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's try to answer the question whether pre-intervention social connectedness (`SCS_pre`) predicts post-intervention loneliness (`Loneliness_post`)?\n\nNot much tidying to do today.\n\n**Step 1:** Select the variables of interest. Store them in a new data object called `dog_reg`. \n\n**Step 2:** Check for missing values and remove participants with missing in either variable.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Hints\n\n**Step 1:** Variables of interest are pre-intervention social connectedness (`SCS_pre`), post-intervention loneliness (`Loneliness_post`), and of course the participant ID (`RID`).\n\n**Step 2:** The function `drop_na()` is your friend.\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution\n\n```{r}\ndog_reg <- dog_data_wide %>%\n  # Step 1\n  select(RID, Loneliness_post, SCS_pre) %>% \n  # Step 2\n  drop_na()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n## Task 5: Visualise the relationship {.unnumbered}\n\nI've used the following code to create a scatterplot to explore the relationship between social connectedness (pre-test) and loneliness (post-test). Can you check I did it correctly?\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dog_reg, aes(x = Loneliness_post, y = SCS_pre)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\nDid I do it right? `r mcq(c(x = \"yes\", answer = \"no\"))`\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution\n\nThe scatterplot is incorrect. Since we are predicting loneliness from social connectedness, the axes should be reversed.\n\nIn a correlation, the order of x and y does not matter, but in a regression, the predictor variable must be on the x-axis, and the outcome variable must be on the y-axis.\n\nHere is the corrected scatterplot:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dog_reg, aes(x = SCS_pre, y = Loneliness_post)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Task 6: Model creating & Assumption checks {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's store our linear model as `mod` and then use the `check_model()` function from the `performance` package to check assumptions.\n\nRemember, the structure of the linear model is:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlm(Outcome~Predictor, data)\n```\n\n\nOnce the model is stored as `mod`, we can check its assumptions using `check_model(mod)`.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution\n\n```{r}\n## creating the linear model\nmod <- lm(Loneliness_post~SCS_pre, data = dog_reg)\n\n## checking model assumptions\ncheck_model(mod)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\nAssumptions 1-3 hold due to the study design, but let’s take a closer look at the following output:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\ncheck_model(mod)\n```\n\n\n* Linearity: The relationship appears to be `r mcq(sample(c(answer = \"linear\", x = \"non-linear\")))`.\n* Normality: The residuals are `r mcq(sample(c(answer = \"approximately normally distributed\", x = \"not normally distributed\")))`.\n* Homoscedasticity: There is `r mcq(sample(c(answer = \"homoscedasticity as there is no distinct pattern in the residuals\", x = \"heteroscedasticity as the residuals show a distinct pattern\")))`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## I don't understand - can you explain more?\n\n* Linearity: The reference line is mostly flat and horizontal. There’s a slight curve at the end, but when checking the scatterplot, it’s not a major concern.\n* Normality: Looking pretty good. The dots fall onto the line, indicating the residuals are approximately normally distributed. A Q-Q plot would show the same outcome, but with the reference line diagonal instead of horizontal.\n* Homoscedasticity (or Homogeneity of Variance): Yeah, the reference line could be a bit more horizontal, but there’s no clear funnel shape. The points appear to have a fairly random pattern, so we can consider the assumption met.\n\n:::\n\n## Task 7: Computing a Simple Regression & interpret the output {.unnumbered}\n\nTo compute the simple regression, we need to use the `summary()` on our linear model `mod`.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nsummary(mod)\n```\n\nHow do you interpret the output?\n\n* The estimate of the y-intercept for the model, rounded to two decimal places, is `r fitb(\"4.40\")`\n\n* The relationship is `r mcq(c(x = \"positive\", answer = \"negative\"))`\n\n* The model indicated that `r mcq(c(answer = \"Social Connectedness significantly predicts Loneliness post intervention.\", x = \"Social Connectedness does not significantly predicts Loneliness post intervention.\"))`\n\n* How much the variance is explained by the model (rounded to two decimal places)? `r fitb(\"74.95\")`%.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"kable","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css","include/booktem.css","include/webex.css","include/glossary.css","include/style.css","include/custom.scss","include/styles.css"],"highlight-style":"a11y","include-after-body":["include/webex.js","include/script.js"],"output-file":"pc-B03.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
