If you need help, have a look at @sec-rmd.\n\n## Task 3: Load in the library and read in the data {.unnumbered}\n\nThe data should already be in your project folder. If you want a fresh copy, you can download the data again here: [data_pair_coding](data/data_pair_coding.zip \"download\").\n\nWe are using the packages `tidyverse` and `correlation` today.\nIf you have already worked through this chapter, you will have all the packages installed. If you have yet to complete @sec-cor, you will need to install the package `correlation` (see @sec-install_packages for guidance if needed).\n\nWe also need to read in `dog_data_clean_wide.csv`. Again, I've named my data object `dog_data_wide` to shorten the name but feel free to use whatever object name sounds intuitive to you. \n\n\n```{r reading in data for me, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(correlation)\n\ndog_data_wide <- read_csv(\"data/dog_data_clean_wide.csv\")\n\ndog_happy <- dog_data_wide %>%\n  select(RID, SHS_pre, SHS_post) %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  mutate(RID = factor(RID))\n```\n\n\n## Task 4: Tidy data & Selecting variables of interest {.unnumbered}\n\n**Step 1:** Select the variables of interest. We need 2 continuous variables today, so any of the pre- vs post-test comparison will do. I would suggest happiness ratings (i.e., `SHS_pre`, `SHS_post`). Also keep the participant id `RID`. Store them in a new data object called `dog_happy`. \n\n**Step 2:** Check for missing values and remove participants with missing in either pre- or post-ratings.\n\n**Step 3:** Convert participant ID into a factor\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution for Tasks 3 and 4\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n## Task 3\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(correlation)\n\ndog_data_wide <- read_csv(\"dog_data_clean_wide.csv\")\n\n\n## Task 4\ndog_happy <- dog_data_wide %>%\n  # Step 1\n  select(RID, SHS_pre, SHS_post) %>% \n  # Step 2\n  drop_na() %>% \n  # Step 3\n  mutate(RID = factor(RID))\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Task 5: Re-create the scatterplot below {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nggplot(dog_happy, aes(x = SHS_pre, y = SHS_post)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nggplot(dog_happy, aes(x = SHS_pre, y = SHS_post)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Task 6: Assumptions check {.unnumbered}\n\nWe can either do the assumption check by looking at the scatterplot above or we can run the code `plot(lm(SHS_pre~SHS_post, data = dog_happy))` and assess the assumptions there. Either way, it should give you similar responses.\n\n* Linearity: a `r mcq(sample(c(answer = \"linear\", x = \"non-linear\")))` relationship\n* Normality: residuals are `r mcq(sample(c(answer = \"approximately normally distributed\", x = \"not normally distributed\")))`\n* Homoscedasticity: There is `r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"homoscedasticity as there is no distinct pattern in the residuals\", x = \"heteroscedasticity as the residuals show a distinct pattern\")))`\n* Outliers: `r mcq(sample(c(answer = \"the data does not have any clear outliers\", x = \"the data has some outliers\")))`\n\n\n\n**What is your conclusion from the assumptions check?**\n\n`r longmcq(c(answer = \"All assumptions hold. Therefore, we are conducting a parametric test, specifically Pearson’s correlation.\", x = \"Some assumptions are violated. Therefore, we are conducting a non-parametric test, specifically Spearman’s correlation.\", x = \"All assumptions are violated. Therefore, we are conducting a non-parametric test, specifically Spearman’s correlation.\"))`\n\n\n\n## Task 7: Compute a Pearson correlation & interpret the output {.unnumbered}\n\n* **Step 1**: Compute the Pearson correlation. The structure of the function is as follows:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ncorrelation(data = your_dataframe,\n            select = \"variable1\",\n            select2 = \"variable2\",\n            method = \"Pearson\",\n            alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\nThe default method argument is Pearson, but if you thought any of the assumptions were violated and conduct a Spearman correlation instead, change the `method` argument to\"Spearman\".\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r}\ncorrelation(data = dog_happy,\n            select = \"SHS_pre\",\n            select2 = \"SHS_post\",\n            method = \"Pearson\",\n            alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# alternative because there are only 2 numeric columns in `dog_happy`\ncorrelation(dog_happy)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n* **Step 2**: Interpret the output\n\n\nA Pearson correlation revealed a `r mcq(c(answer = \"strong\", x = \"moderately strong\", x = \"weak\"))`, `r mcq(c(answer = \"positive\", x = \"negative\"))`, and statistically `r mcq(c(answer = \"significant\", x = \"non-significant\"))` relationship between happiness before and after the dog intervention, *r*(`r fitb(\"281\")`) = `r fitb(c(\".88\", \".884\"))`, *p* `r fitb(c(\"<.001\", \"< .001\"))`, *95% CI* = [`r fitb(c(\".86\", \".856\"))`, `r fitb(c(\".91\", \".907\"))`]. We therefore `r mcq(c(x = \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\", answer = \"reject the null hypothesis in favour of H1\"))`.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nIn the write-up paragraph above, the open fields accepted answers with 2 or 3 decimal places as correct. However, in your reports, ensure that correlation values are reported with 3 decimal places.\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"kable","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css","include/booktem.css","include/webex.css","include/glossary.css","include/style.css","include/custom.scss","include/styles.css"],"highlight-style":"a11y","include-after-body":["include/webex.js","include/script.js"],"output-file":"pc-B02.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
