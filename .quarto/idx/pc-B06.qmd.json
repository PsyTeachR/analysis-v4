If you want a fresh copy, you can download the data again here: [data_pair_coding](data/data_pair_coding.zip \"download\").\n\nWe are using the packages `afex`, `tidyverse`, and `performance` today, and need to read in `dog_data_clean_long`. \n\n```{r reading in data for me, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(afex)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\n\ndog_data_long <- read_csv(\"data/dog_data_clean_long.csv\")\n\ndog_factorial_anova <- dog_data_long %>%\n  select(RID, Year_of_Study, Stage, SHS) %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  group_by(RID) %>% \n  mutate(RID_count = n()) %>% \n  filter(RID_count == 2)\n\nmod <- aov_ez(id = \"RID\",\n       data = dog_factorial_anova, \n       between = \"Year_of_Study\", \n       within = \"Stage\",\n       dv = \"SHS\", \n       type = 3,\n       anova_table = list(es = \"pes\")) \n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(afex)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\n\ndog_data_long <- read_csv(\"dog_data_clean_long.csv\")\n  \n```\n:::\n\n## Task 4: Tidy data & Selecting variables of interest  {.unnumbered}\n\n\nLet's define a potential research question:\n\n**How does the Year of Study (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or above) and Time point (pre- and post-intervention scores) affect perceived Happiness?**\n\nThis is a 2 x 5 mixed factorial ANOVA, with one `r mcq(c(x = \"between-subjects factor\", answer = \"within-subjects factor\"))` (Stage: pre vs. post) and one `r mcq(c(answer = \"between-subjects factor\", x = \"within-subjects factor\"))` (year of study: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or above). The `r mcq(c(x = \"independent\", answer = \"dependent\"))` variable is self-reported Happiness Score.\n\nNot much tidying to do today. All the variables and average scores are already tidied up in `dog_data_long`. We just need to check for missing values in our variables of interest. Best to do this on a reduced dataframe.\n\n* select the variables of interest and store them in a new data object called `dog_factorial_anova`\n* check for missing values and remove participants who did not have pre- and post-intervention Happiness recorded\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Hints\n\n* You need 4 variables: Participant ID, Year of Study, Time point of recording (i.e., pre- or post-intervention), and the self-reported Happiness scores.\n* You should have identified 1 participant who did not complete both ratings. There are 2 options on how to achieve that: \n  * Option 1: identify the missing value visually and filter out their participant ID (works well with smaller dataframes, but not very reproducible) \n  * Option 2: remove the missing value line first and then add a new columns to count how often each participant is now represented in the data object and then only include Participants with a count of 2 ratings in this case (which is the more reproducible option and more appropriate with larger dataframes or when there are loads of missing values).\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n\n```{r}\n## Option 1\ndog_factorial_anova <- dog_data_long %>%\n  select(RID, Year_of_Study, Stage, SHS) %>% \n  filter(RID != 12)\n\n## Option 2\ndog_factorial_anova <- dog_data_long %>%\n  select(RID, Year_of_Study, Stage, SHS) %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  group_by(RID) %>% \n  mutate(RID_count = n()) %>% \n  filter(RID_count == 2)\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Task 5: Model creating & Assumption checks {.unnumbered}\n\nNow, let's create our ANOVA model.\n\nAccording to our research question we have the following model variables *(use the spelling of the variable names in `dog_factorial_anova`)*: \n\n* Dependent Variable (DV): `r fitb(\"SHS\")`, assessed pre- and post-intervention\n* Independent Variable 1 (IV 1): `r fitb(\"Year_of_Study\")` (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or above) \n* Independent Variable 2 (IV 2): `r fitb(\"Stage\")` (pre- and post-intervention scores)\n\n\nAs a reminder, the ANOVA model has the following structure:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nmod <- aov_ez(id = \"NULL\",\n       data = NULL, \n       between = \"NULL\", \n       within = \"NULL\",\n       dv = \"NULL\", \n       type = 3,\n       anova_table = list(es = \"NULL\"))\n\n```\n\n\nLet’s use this template to fill in our variables of interest and store the model in a separate object called `mod`. The effect size should be partial eta squared (`\"pes\"`):\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nmod <- aov_ez(id = \"RID\",\n       data = dog_factorial_anova, \n       between = \"Year_of_Study\", \n       within = \"Stage\",\n       dv = \"SHS\", \n       type = 3,\n       anova_table = list(es = \"pes\")) \n```\n\n:::\n\n\nLet's check some assumptions.\n\n```{r}\ncheck_model(mod)\ncheck_homogeneity(mod, method = \"levene\")\n```\n\nAre the following assumptions met or violated?\n\n* Assumption 1: Continuous DV? `r mcq(c(answer = \"Assumption met\", \"Assumption violated\"))`\n* Assumption 2: Data are independent? `r mcq(c(answer = \"Assumption met\", \"Assumption violated\"))`\n* Assumption 3: Normality? `r mcq(c(answer = \"Assumption met\", \"Assumption violated\"))`\n* Assumption 4: Homoscedasticity? `r mcq(c(answer = \"Assumption met\", \"Assumption violated\"))`\n\n\n\n## Task 6: Interpreting the output {.unnumbered}\n\nCall the model object to view the ANOVA results:\n\n```{r}\nmod\n```\n\nHow do you interpret the results?\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"The main effect of Year of Study and the interaction are not significant, but the main effect of timepoint is.\", x = \"The main effect of Year of Study and the interaction are significant, but the main effect of timepoint is not.\", x = \"The effect size (ηₚ² = 0.067) suggests a small effect of timepoint on the outcome variable.\", x = \"The F-value (F = 19.86) indicates a large effect of timepoint on the outcome variable.\")))`\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"kable","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css","include/booktem.css","include/webex.css","include/glossary.css","include/style.css","include/custom.scss","include/styles.css"],"highlight-style":"a11y","include-after-body":["include/webex.js","include/script.js"],"output-file":"pc-B06.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
