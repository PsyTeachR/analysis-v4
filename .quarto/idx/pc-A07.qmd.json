If you need help, have a look at @sec-rmd.\n\n## Task 3: Load in the library and read in the data {.unnumbered}\n\nThe data should already be in your project folder. If you want a fresh copy, you can download the data again here: [data_pair_coding](data/data_pair_coding.zip \"download\").\n\nWe are using the packages `tidyverse`, `car`, and `lsr` today, and the data file we need to read in is `dog_data_clean_wide.csv`. I've named my data object `dog_data_wide` to shorten the name but feel free to use whatever object name sounds intuitive to you.\n\nIf you have not worked through chapter 7 yet, you may need to install a few packages first before you can load them into the library, for example, if `car` is missing, run `install.packages(\"car\")` in your **CONSOLE**.\n\n```{r reading in data for me, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(lsr)\n\ndog_data_wide <- read_csv(\"data/dog_data_clean_wide.csv\")\ndog_data_long <- read_csv(\"data/dog_data_clean_long.csv\")\n\n## I need dog_independent\ndog_independent <- dog_data_wide %>% \n  # Step 1\n  select(RID, GroupAssignment, Flourishing_post) %>% \n  # Step 2\n  filter(GroupAssignment %in% c(\"Control\", \"Direct\")) %>% \n  # Step 3\n  mutate(GroupAssignment = factor(GroupAssignment))\n```\n\n\n## Task 4: Tidy data for a two-sample t-test {.unnumbered}\n\nFor today’s task, we want to analyse how **students’ psychological well-being scores** differed at the **post_intervention** time point. Specifically, we will compare the scores of students who directly interacted with the dogs (Group `direct`)to those who only talked to the dog handlers (Group `control`).\n\n\nTo achieve that, we need to select all relevant columns from `dog_data_wide`, and narrow down the dataframe to only include students assigned either to the `direct` or the `control` groups.\n\n\n* **Step 1**: Select all relevant columns from `dog_data_wide`. For the task at hand, those would be the participant ID `RID`, `GroupAssignment`, and `Flourishing_post`. Store this data in an object called `dog_independent`.\n\n* **Step 2**: Narrow down `dog_independent` to only include `GroupAssignment` groups `direct` or the `control`.\n\n* **Step 3**: Convert `GroupAssignment` into a factor.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Hints\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ndog_independent <- ??? %>% \n  # Step 1\n  select(???, ???, ???) %>% \n  # Step 2\n  filter(??? %in% c(???, ???)) %>% \n  # Step 3\n  mutate(GroupAssignment = ???())\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution for Tasks 3 and 4\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# loading tidyverse and lsr into the library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(lsr)\n\n# reading in `dog_data_clean_wide.csv`\ndog_data_wide <- read_csv(\"dog_data_clean_wide.csv\")\n\n# Task 4: Tidying \ndog_independent <- dog_data_wide %>% \n  # Step 1\n  select(RID, GroupAssignment, Flourishing_post) %>% \n  # Step 2\n  filter(GroupAssignment %in% c(\"Control\", \"Direct\")) %>% \n  # Step 3\n  mutate(GroupAssignment = factor(GroupAssignment))\n\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n## Task 5: Compute descriptives {.unnumbered}\n\nCalculate the sample size (n), the mean, and the standard deviation of the psychological well-being score for both groups. Save the output in an object called `dog_independent_descriptives`. The resulting dataframe should look like this:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\ndog_independent_descriptives <- dog_independent %>% \n  group_by(GroupAssignment) %>% \n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean_Flourishing = mean(Flourishing_post),\n            sd_Flourishing = sd(Flourishing_post)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\ndog_independent_descriptives %>% \n  kbl() %>%\n  kable_styling()\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Hints\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ndog_independent_descriptives <- dog_independent %>% \n  group_by(???) %>% \n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean_Flourishing = mean(???),\n            sd_Flourishing = sd(???)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# Task 5: Means & SD\ndog_independent_descriptives <- dog_independent %>% \n  group_by(GroupAssignment) %>% \n  summarise(n = n(), \n            mean_Flourishing = mean(Flourishing_post),\n            sd_Flourishing = sd(Flourishing_post)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Task 6: Check assumptions {.unnumbered}\n\n\n#### Assumption 1: Continuous DV {.unnumbered} \n\nIs the dependent variable (DV) continuous? Answer: `r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"Yes. The DV is called Flourishing and it is continuous\", x = \"No. The DV is called Flourishing and it is categorical\", x = \"No. The DV is called GroupAssignment and it is categorical\", x = \"Yes. The DV is called GroupAssignment and it is continuous\")))`\n\n#### Assumption 2: Data are independent {.unnumbered} \n\nEach observation in the dataset has to be independent, meaning the value of one observation does not affect the value of any other. Answer: `r mcq(c(answer = \"yes\", x = \"no\"))`\n\n#### Assumption 3: Homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance) {.unnumbered} \n\nI've computed Levene's test below. How do you interpret the output?\n\n```{r}\nleveneTest(Flourishing_post ~ GroupAssignment, data = dog_independent)\n```\nAnswer: `r longmcq(c(x = \"The p-value of Levene's test is significant, therefore we conclude that there is a difference between the variances in the population.\", x = \"The p-value of Levene's test is non-significant, therefore we conclude that there is a difference between the variances in the population.\", x = \"The p-value of Levene's test is significant, therefore we conclude that the variances in the population are equal.\", answer = \"The p-value of Levene's test is non-significant, therefore we conclude that the variances in the population are equal.\"))`\n\n#### Assumption 4: DV should be approximately normally distributed {.unnumbered}\n\nLooking at the violin-boxplot below, are both groups normally distributed?\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dog_independent, aes(x = GroupAssignment, y = Flourishing_post, fill = GroupAssignment)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"cividis\", guide = \"none\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Group\", y = \"Psychological well-being (post-intervention)\")\n```\n\nAnswer:\n\n`r longmcq(c(x = \"yes, both groups are normally distributed\", answer = \"no, both groups are sightly skewed\", x = \"no, both groups are extremely skewed\"))`\n\n#### Conclusion from assumption tests {.unnumbered}\n\nWith all assumptions tested, which statistical test would you recommend for this analysis?\n\n\n\nAnswer: `r longmcq(c(x = \"All assumptions held. We will conduct a Student two-sample t-test.\", answer = \"The assumption of normality was violated. We will conduct a Welch two-sample t-test because it has been shown to be robust to slight deviations from normality (Delacre et al., 2017).\", x = \"The assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were violated. Therefore, we will conduct a non-parametric test.\"))`\n\n\n## Task 7: Computing a two-sample t-test with effect size & interpret the output {.unnumbered}\n\n* **Step 1**: Compute the Welch two-sample t-test. The structure of the function is as follows:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nt.test(DV ~ IV, data = your_dataframe, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nt.test(Flourishing_post ~ GroupAssignment, data = dog_independent, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n* **Step 2**: Calculate an effect size\n\nCalculate Cohen's D. The structure of the function is as follows:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ncohensD(DV ~ IV, data = your_dataframe, method = \"unequal\")\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ncohensD(Flourishing_post ~ GroupAssignment, data = dog_independent, method = \"unequal\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n* **Step 3**: Interpreting the output\n\nBelow are the outputs for the **descriptive statistics** (table), **Welch t-test** (main output), and **Cohen’s D** (last line starting with [1]). Based on these, write up the results in APA style and provide an interpretation.\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\ndog_independent_descriptives\n\nt.test(Flourishing_post ~ GroupAssignment, data = dog_independent, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\ncohensD(Flourishing_post ~ GroupAssignment, data = dog_independent, method = \"unequal\")\n```\n\n\nThe Welch two-sample t-test revealed that there is `r mcq(c(x = \"a statistically significant difference\", answer = \"no statistically significant difference\"))` in psychological well-being scores between direct (*N* = `r fitb(\"95\")`, *M* = `r fitb(\"5.78\")`, *SD* = `r fitb(\"0.86\")`) and control group (*N* = `r fitb(\"94\")`, *M* = `r fitb(\"5.72\")`, *SD* = `r fitb(\"0.77\")`), *t*(`r fitb(\"185.05\")`) = `r fitb(\"0.49\")`, *p* = `r fitb(\".625\")`, *d* = `r fitb(\"0.07\")`. The strength of the association between the variables is considered `r mcq(c(answer = \"small\", x = \"medium\", x = \"large\"))`. We therefore `r mcq(c(answer = \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\", x = \"reject the null hypothesis in favour of H1\"))`.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"kable","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css","include/booktem.css","include/webex.css","include/glossary.css","include/style.css","include/custom.scss","include/styles.css"],"highlight-style":"a11y","include-after-body":["include/webex.js","include/script.js"],"output-file":"pc-A07.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
